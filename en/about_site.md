zgfabian.github.io is the personal blog and portfolio website created by me. It is made with Jekyll, and GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so one can easily deploy a site using GitHub (or other hosting company) for free. The theme (BeautifulTheme) was a little bit customized. The Blablabla logo is besed on sticker created by my daughter. The image galleries use lightbox.js which was adapted to Jekyll's templating language (Liquid) by JekyllCodex.
