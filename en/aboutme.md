>I know flies in milk  
>I know the man by his clothes  
>I know fair weather from foul  
>I know the apple by the tree  
>I know the tree when I see the sap  
>I know when all is one  
>I know who labors and who loafs  
>I know everything but myself.

**Francois Villon**: Ballade (translated by Galway M. Kinnell)
