I know flies in milk  
I know the man by his clothes  
I know fair weather from foul  
I know the apple by the tree  
I know the tree when I see the sap  
I know when all is one  
I know who labors and who loafs  
I know everything but myself.

Francois Villon: Ballade (translated by Galway M. Kinnell)
