"ABOUT 13.5 BILLION YEARS AGO, MATTER, energy, time and space came into being in what is known as the Big Bang. The story of these fundamental features of our universe is called physics.
{: .box-note}
About 300,000 years after their appearance, matter and energy started to coalesce into complex structures, called atoms, which then combined into molecules. The story of atoms, molecules and their interactions is called chemistry.
{: .box-note}
About 3.8 billion years ago, on a planet called Earth, certain molecules combined to form particularly large and intricate structures called organisms. The story of organisms is called biology.
{: .box-note}
About 70,000 years ago, organisms belonging to the species Homo sapiens started to form even more elaborate structures called cultures. The subsequent development of these human cultures is called history."

Minden tudományterületnek vannak axiómái, melyekkel nem vitatkozik. Az egyik ilyen például a biológia területén az **evolúció**.





You can export the result even in html format, or you can publish it on [Rpubs](http://rpubs.com/ZGFabian/514062). Other useful package is "[timevis](https://daattali.com/shiny/timevis-demo/)".
