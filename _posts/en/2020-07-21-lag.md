Sometimes one needs to create new variables by finding the ["previous" (lag()) or "next" (lead()) values](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/lead-lag.html) in a vector (e.g. in a df column). A real-world example is [first order differencing in a time-series analysis](https://fromthebottomoftheheap.net/assets/materials/courses/2013/mcmaster/time-series.pdf), where new series formed by subtracting  \\(x_{t-1}\\) from \\(x_{t}\\). 
\\[\nabla x_t=x_{t}-x_{t-1}\\]
The following R snippet is a simple demo of lag and lead functions.

### Just a tibble containing columns defined with `lag()` & `lead()`
Lets create a [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/) with [`tibble()`](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html#creating-tibbles) function:

```r
df <- tibble(
   x = c(28, 25, 24, 17, 10),
   lagx = lag(x),
   leadx = lead(x),
   diff = x - lead(x))
```
The result is:

	# A tibble: 5 x 4
	      x  lagx leadx  diff
	  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
	1    28    NA    25     3
	2    25    28    24     1
	3    24    25    17     7
	4    17    24    10     7
	5    10    17    NA    NA

Note that `diff` is actually equal to the aforementioned first order difference (\\(\nabla x_t\\)).

### tidyverse-way with [pipe (`%>%`) and mutate](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html)

```r
df %>% mutate(diff2 = x - lead(x))
```

`diff2` is same as `diff`:

	# A tibble: 5 x 5
	      x  lagx leadx  diff diff2
	  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
	1    28    NA    25     3     3
	2    25    28    24     1     1
	3    24    25    17     7     7
	4    17    24    10     7     7
	5    10    17    NA    NA    NA
