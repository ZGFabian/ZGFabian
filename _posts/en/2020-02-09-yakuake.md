`yakuake` is a "drop-down" (or "top-down") terminal inspired by the renowned [Quake terminal](/img/20-02-09/quake_terminal.jpg). If you do not know Quake, than you must be either too young or just simply don't like shooting others, at least virtually. Quake is a First Person Shooting (FPS) game released in 1996.   
Another Quake-like terminal program is `guake` that was developed for Gnome desktop environment (DE). In the **G**NU **G**nome Universe every word starts with letter **G**. That's while - beside copyright issues - they called guake. I was aware it have known that and guake as well. But wasn't aware that in some slang guake means "a guy who talks to many girls in a flirtatious mannor[(sic!)](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Guake)". But who the hack wants flirting using a dropdown terminal??? No matter how sexy it is. (cf. [www.terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy/) And know what? "Yakuake" come from **Y**et **A**nother **K**uake abbreviation. Why not YAQuake? Because, ya**K**uake is for **K**DE DE. And in the Universe of KDE every word starts with K - as you probably found out. Incidentally KDE (like **K**(ool)DE) project started in 1996, in the very same year, when Quake adoration started.   
Turning back to the point: Once you started yakuake and pressed `F12` key, it is "dropping down" smoothly to your focus. It will stay there till ~~the end of the world~~ you press `F12` button again. Thank God [(and the developers)](https://youtu.be/t0wy2JYzRZg) the dropdown animation is customizable with `Ctrl+Shift+,` keys and you can even disable it. Though, the "F12 magic" will persist. You can do anything, like press `Alt-Tab` or whatever, yakuake remains "Ã¼ber alles" window.   
Beside this, yakuake is very similar to `konsole` terminal. So why to use it at all, if you are not Quake fanatic? Compared to "basic" konsole, it has some nice extra functionalities. One is multi-pane views, which is different from using multi-tabs.   
Geeks be warned not to expect tiling window managers (e.g. i3-wm) functions. For example, you can not *move* terminals, but you can easily switch between them by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Up`. Horribile dictu mouse is working like on a normal DE!

You can view and edit configuration at: `~/.config/yakuakerc` 

People who are using terminals are usually keyboard-addicts. So they should learn key-combos. Note that sessions are tabbed terminals. More than one terminal can be on one session (tab). That I called multi-pane view. [Cf. image.](#todo) It is a little bit confusing.  So have a look at yakuakerc.
