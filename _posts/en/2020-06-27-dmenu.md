dmenu is a [suckless](https://dwm.suckless.org/) program and a lot of tiling window managers (eg. [i3](https://i3wm.org/), [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)) use it as default application launcher. 

`dmenu_run` is a shortcut for `dmenu_path | dmenu "$@" | ${SHELL:-"/bin/sh"} &`. When you invoke your dmenu command, dmenu_run will start by default. At its place (`which dmenu_run`) - usually `usr/bin` - one can easily hack dmenu or create an alternative for the default. Try out from a terminal: 

	dmenu_path | dmenu -b "$@" | ${SHELL:-"/bin/sh"}

Spoiler: `-b` option puts the menu to the bottom of the desktop. Just a small step for the mankind.
