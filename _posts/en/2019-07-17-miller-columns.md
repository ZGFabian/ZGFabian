“**Miller columns** (also known as **cascading lists**) are a browsing/visualization technique that can be applied to tree structures. The columns allow multiple levels of the hierarchy to be open at once, and provide a visual representation of the current location. It is closely related to techniques used earlier in the Smalltalk browser, but was independently invented by [Mark S. Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_S._Miller) in 1980 at Yale University. The technique was then used at [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu), [Datapoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint), and [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT).” 
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns))

A recent example of using Miller columns is [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), a console file manager with VIM key bindings.
