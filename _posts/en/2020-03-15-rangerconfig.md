Configuration files are located at /etc/range/config/

 - `commands.py`: contains various functions' implementation, written in Python, used to modify ranger's behavior,
 - `rc.conf`: is used for setting various options and binding the keys to functions,
 - `rifle.conf`: decides which program to use for opening which file,
 - `scope.sh`: is a shell script used to generate the previews for various file types.

It's quite common to use `ranger --copy-config=all` to copy the default config files to `~/.config/ranger` and modify them there.
