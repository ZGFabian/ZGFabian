I am a great fan of Freecell solitaire card game that is part of aisleriot package. There are some built-in card themes, but one can install a custom set as well. Steps to do so:

1. Download the theme (uncompressif necessary)
2. Copy the svgz file to `/usr/share/aisleriot/cards/` folder. 

Here are my favorites: 1. dark version of C1 card set (C1B) from [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1303420/) 
2. [Sin city](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1303093/)
