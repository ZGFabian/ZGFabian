Just a simple hack to disable focus change on mouse move in [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/). 

comment out the following line in dwm.c:

	/* [EnterNotify] = enternotify, */

Thanks for the tipp to KiteAnton [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/suckless/comments/apz54q/dwm_disable_focus_change_on_mouse_move/) user.

If you have not already known dwm, you can get a passionate [intro from Luke Smith's vlog episode](https://youtu.be/unqsQJaECv0) or a more technical [guide from Dave Gauer's blog](https://ratfactor.com/dwm).
