“**Miller columns** (also known as **cascading lists**) are a [browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager#Navigational_file_manager)/[visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_visualization) technique that can be applied to [tree structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)). The columns allow multiple levels of the hierarchy to be open at once, and provide a visual representation of the current location. It is closely related to techniques used earlier in the [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) browser, but was independently invented by [Mark S. Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_S._Miller) in 1980 at [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University). The technique was then used at [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu), [Datapoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datapoint), and [NeXT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT).” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_columns))

A recent example of using Miller columns is  [Ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger), a console based file browser.
